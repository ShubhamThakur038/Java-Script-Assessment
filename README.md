Title: MyToken 

Description:

This Solidity contract implements a basic token named "[Nobita]" with the abbreviation [Nobi]". It allows for minting and burning of tokens, but currently doesn't include transfer functionality.

Features:

Stores token name, abbreviation, and total supply.
Mints tokens to an address and increases the total supply.
Burns tokens from an address and decreases the total supply (with balance check).
How to Use:

Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler (e.g., solc).
Deploy the contract to a blockchain network.
Use the mint function to mint tokens to an address.
Use the burn function to burn tokens from an address (ensure sufficient balance).
Further Considerations:

This is a basic implementation and lacks features like token transfer and access control.
Consider adding events for minting and burning to track these actions on the blockchain.
Implement an ownership mechanism to restrict minting and burning to authorized users.
