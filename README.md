 All the concepts required in this project were being learnt through the course provided by the Metacrafters team.
 
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that defines a basic token named "NObita". Below, you'll find details about the contract, including its features, instructions, and usage. 

Features: Token Details: Publicly accessible variables that store the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.

Public Variables tokenName: The name of the token ("Nobita"). 

TokenAbbrv: The abbreviation of the token ("Nobi").

TotalSupply: The total supply of tokens in existence.
 
Burn Function: Decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, with a check to ensure sufficient balance.

Balances Mapping: A mapping that keeps track of each address's token balance.

Mint Function: Increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address. 

The contract is implemented in Solidity and includes the following key components:

 Burn Function: The burn function decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, ensuring the balance is sufficient before performing the operation.

Mint Function: The mint function increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address.

Balances Mapping balances: A mapping from addresses to their respective token balances.
